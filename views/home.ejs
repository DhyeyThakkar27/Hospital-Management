        <p>Good Health is important because a man of health can enjoy great happiness during his life time. Without health we cannot do anything,<br>in this world. A man suffering from fever remains confined to bed. He cannot get out of doors. He cannot do anything for anybody.
            <br>
        Health is more valuable than wealth. Even a poor peasant with good health is happier than the rich person with poor health.

                     details about the free COVID-19 virtual screening for Indiana residents<br> 
                     and how we're keeping you safe at your upcoming appointments.<br>
                     Do stay home and take Tylenol, cough syrup and plenty of rest if <br>
                     you think you may have COVID-19. You should also isolate yourself <br>
                     from your other family members, and use a designated bathroom in the <br>
                     house that no one else is using. If your symptoms are mild and can be<br>
                      managed at home, you are unlikely to get a COVID-19 test based on <br>
                      current guidelines in Colorado and it reduces your risk if you avoid <br>
                      going to the doctor. If you have shortness of breath, or are in a high-risk<br> 
                      group or have progressive symptoms, call your doctorâ€™s office right away.<br>
